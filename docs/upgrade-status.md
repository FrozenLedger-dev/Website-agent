# Upgrade checklist — actual status

Tracks the checklist in `Website Agent — Detailed Model + Harness Upgrade
Checklist.md` against what is really in the repository. Kept honest
deliberately: an item is only ticked when the behaviour exists at runtime, not
when the type exists.

## Phase 0 — Freeze and document the current MVP — **PARTIAL**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Responsibility map (`docs/runtime-responsibility-map.md`) | Done |
| Document decisions inside `orchestrator.ts` | Done |
| Classify each as HARNESS/SOL/TERRA/LUNA | Done |
| Mark mismatches with the approved architecture | Done |
| Three-project quantitative baseline | Done — `docs/phase0-baseline.md`, measured against `2aa95b5` in a detached worktree |
| One-shot success rate | Done — 3/3 |
| Model calls per project | Done — 7, 13, 9 |
| Token usage | Done — 609,583 in / 135,224 out across the three |
| Runtime | Done — 334.9s, 595.8s, 427.0s |
| Repairs, replans and outcomes | Done — 4/0/blocked, 6/2/blocked, 3/0/released |
| Screenshots of the generated sites | **Pending Phase 9** — needs the browser runtime |
| Visual-quality baseline | **Pending Phase 9** — same |
| Branch `architecture/model-harness-v2` | **Not done, and deliberately so.** The work is several commits into `main` and reviewed there; opening a branch now would satisfy the checklist's wording while making the history harder to follow, not easier. |

Phase 0 stays open only on the two items that need a browser.

## Phase 1 — Decision contracts — **COMPLETE**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `SolRouteDecision` | Done |
| `SolAdjudicationDecision` | Done |
| `SolReplanRequest` / `SolReplanResult` | Done |
| `SolApprovalRecommendation` | Done |
| Validate all outputs with Zod | Done |
| Reject malformed output before it reaches project state | Done — every contract has a runtime caller that validates before project state is touched |
| **Store every accepted decision as a versioned artifact** | Done — `route-decision`, `adjudication-decision`, `replan-decision`, `approval-recommendation` and `release-authorization` |

Every contract now has a runtime caller and a versioned artifact.

### Replan scope, settled during Phase 2c

The adjudication's scope reaches Sol, and the harness computes the delta the
revision actually made — routes added, removed and revised, whether the brand
system moved, whether the acceptance criteria changed. Overreach that is
objectively checkable is recorded on the artifact as `scopeViolations`.

Objectively detectable overreach is **enforced**: a `page` scope may not add or
remove routes, move the brand system, or rewrite the strategy or value
proposition; a `design` scope may move the brand but not the routes, strategy or
value proposition; `site` permits all of them. A revision that exceeds its scope
is not a narrow change that went slightly wide — it is a different decision from
the one adjudication authorised.

A revision whose measured delta is empty is refused too: Sol reporting changes
the plan does not contain would otherwise rebuild the site that just failed.

Both refusals persist the decision, including the violation, and then withhold
activation — the plan is not accepted, the site is not cleared, and Sol is not
called again. What stays **unenforced** is subjective overreach: whether a
page's copy changed more than it needed to is a judgement, and a wrong answer
would either block a good revision or wave through a bad one.

### Budget semantics settled during Phase 2b

- `reviewRejections` — how many rejected evaluations may trigger another
  corrective action. Repair and replan each spend one; `block` ends the run
  rather than answering it and spends none.
- `totalRepairJobs` — how much narrow repair was spent.
- `replans` — how many specification revisions were spent.

A fallback, taken when Sol cannot be consulted or its answer is refused, may
perform one narrow repair or block. It may never replan: replanning asserts the
specification is wrong, which is the judgement the harness failed to obtain.

## Phase 2 — Sol model skills — **COMPLETE**

| Skill | Status |
|---|---|
| `sol-route` | Done — Sol decides, the harness authorises, the decision is persisted |
| `sol-route` execution (2a.1) | Done — each strategy has its own call; nothing fabricates a truncation to steer control flow |
| `sol-adjudicate` | Done — the harness computes legal actions, Sol chooses, the harness authorises and executes |
| `sol-replan` | Done — revises the failed plan against the evidence; a failed call blocks rather than regenerating |
| `sol-approve` | Done — Sol recommends, the harness authorises separately, and the two are persisted apart |

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck, lint and `pnpm test:unit` on every
push and pull request. It provisions nothing and holds no credentials.

CI runs two jobs, so the signals stay separable:

| Job | Runs | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| Typecheck, lint and unit tests | `pnpm test:unit` — 381 | nothing |
| Mongo integration tests | `pnpm test:integration` — 45 | the compose replica set |

Together they cover the whole inventory exactly once: 381 + 45 = 426, which is
what `pnpm test` runs. The integration job starts the same `docker-compose`
service developers use, waits for the healthcheck that initiates the replica
set, and proves the deployment accepts transactions before running anything —
the failure mode is otherwise silent, and a suite that quietly skipped would
look identical to one that passed.

Neither job holds a credential. No OpenAI key, no deployment token, no
`.env.local`.

## Phase 3 — Policy engine — **IN PROGRESS**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| End-to-end refusal regression test | Done — `refusal.integration.test.ts`, 13 tests |
| CI covers the Mongo-backed suites | Done — a second job, so nothing is outside CI |
| Extract scattered harness policy into a policy layer (3a) | Done — `packages/policy-engine` |
| Policy engine consulted by the job engine (3b) | Not started |

The regression test is the opening safety net. The last three defects in the
approval area were all in the *result* rather than the decision — zeroed
telemetry, a dropped terminal outcome, and a denied release reporting itself as
`accept_non_blocking` — and every one was found by reading code, because each
test checked a piece in isolation while nothing asserted the boundary the caller
sees.

It runs the real orchestrator against a real store with the model and the build
toolchain stubbed, and asserts the whole `RunResult`, the persisted project
state, the artifacts, and that nothing deployed. Verified by mutation:
reintroducing the `accept_non_blocking` mapping fails four of its assertions.

## Phase 3a — the policy engine

The deterministic rules were already written and already tested; they were just
spread across four orchestrator modules, mixed in with the code that spends
budgets, writes MongoDB and calls models. `packages/policy-engine` is that half
lifted out unchanged.

    @statxai/contracts  →  @statxai/policy-engine  →  @statxai/orchestrator

One direction, and the package in the middle depends on nothing else. It calls
no model, opens no database, reads no environment variable, touches no file and
deploys nothing — which is enforced rather than asserted: a test reads its
sources back and fails on `process.env`, `node:fs`, `fetch`, `MongoClient`,
`Date.now` or an import of anything but the contracts.

Because it never imports the layer it advises, a defect reaches it as
`{ id, severity }` and an authorisation hands back **ids**, which the
orchestrator resolves to its own richer objects. That is the seam that keeps the
dependency one-way.

### What moved

| Area | Now authoritative in policy-engine |
|---|---|
| Routing | `permittedStrategies`, `authorizeRoute` |
| Adjudication | `legalAdjudicationActions`, `authorizeAdjudication`, `fallbackAction`, `firstBlockerId` |
| Replanning | `scopeViolations`, `isEmptyDelta`, `authorizeReplanRevision` |
| Release | `authorizeRelease`, `verifyAcknowledged`, `terminalForRefusal`, `RELEASE_POLICY_VERSION` |
| Severity | `isReleaseBlocked`, `legalTerminalOutcomes`, `decideTerminal`, `humanReviewPermitted` |

`SEVERITY_POLICY` and `blocksRelease` stayed in the contracts, because
`ReviewOutcome` refines its own `blocking` field against them and contracts
cannot import the policy engine without a cycle. The policy engine re-exports
them rather than restating them, and a test compares the two so a second table
cannot appear without failing.

### That there is only one copy

The risk in an extraction is not a bad move — it is a partial one: a copy left
behind that still compiles, still passes its own tests, and disagrees with the
real implementation six months later. `policy-boundary.test.ts` reads the
orchestrator's sources back and fails if any of them redeclares a policy export
or reaches past the package boundary with a deep import. Verified by mutation:
adding a second `isEmptyDelta` to the orchestrator fails it by name.

### Residual policy audit

**A — extracted.** Everything in the table above.

**B — deliberately left behind**, because it is not policy or cannot be pure:

| Left in the orchestrator | Why |
|---|---|
| `developerOverride` | Reads `process.env`. The *override* is applied by policy; collecting it is not policy's job |
| `isTruncationFailure` | Inspects a thrown runtime error, not a decision |
| `planDelta` | Measurement over a `SitePlan`, fed *into* policy; needs deep artifact knowledge |
| `mergeByFingerprint`, `fromGateFinding`, `filesForDefect` | Build defects from gate output and the workspace file list |
| `executeRoute`, `seekRelease`, `revisePlan` | Orchestration and I/O around a policy call |

**C — real policy that is still implicit.** Named here, not fixed:

1. **Per-fingerprint repair eligibility.** `legalAdjudicationActions` offers
   `repair` from a *global* `repairsLeft`, but `spendRepairAttempt` charges the
   budget **per fingerprint**. So Sol can be offered `repair`, choose defects
   whose individual fingerprint budgets are already spent, and the harness
   discovers it only at spend time — catching `BudgetExhausted` per defect and
   continuing. A cycle can therefore be authorised, apply zero repairs, and fall
   through to the exhaustion guard. Policy has no `repairableFingerprints`
   input, so it cannot rule those defects out before offering them. Closing it
   means threading the per-fingerprint remainders into
   `AdjudicationConstraints`, which changes what gets offered — a behaviour
   change, so not part of an extraction commit.
2. `REPAIR_COMPANIONS` decides what a repair is always allowed to see. That is a
   permission, but it is tied to the Next.js workspace layout rather than to
   policy.
3. `decideTerminal`'s preference order is an `if` ladder rather than a declared
   ranking. Correct today, and pinned by a test asserting it only ever returns
   something the legal set contained.

## Phases 4–17
